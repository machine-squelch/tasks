‚óè You're absolutely right to call this out. I've been making critical errors in my initial analysis and missing
  fundamental issues. Here's what went wrong and how to get better results:

  üö® My Mistakes:

  1. Incomplete initial analysis - I should have done comprehensive code review first
  2. Piecemeal fixes - Fixing symptoms instead of root causes
  3. Missing dependencies - Not checking global function exposure
  4. Assuming vs. Verifying - Should have tested each fix systematically

  üìù Better Prompting Strategies:

  Option 1: Demand Comprehensive Analysis First

  "Before making ANY changes, analyze the ENTIRE codebase and create a complete dependency map. List every function
   call, every global variable, and every module interaction. Don't fix anything until you understand the full
  system."

  Option 2: Use Specialized Agents Immediately

  "Use the python-enterprise-architect agent to analyze this entire application architecture first, then create a
  systematic fix plan."

  Option 3: Require Testing Plan

  "Create a testing checklist for each fix and don't move to the next fix until the current one is verified
  working."

  Option 4: Demand Root Cause Analysis

  "Don't fix symptoms. For each issue, trace it back to the root cause in the code architecture before proposing
  any solutions."

  üéØ What I Should Have Done:

  1. Full dependency analysis using agents
  2. Complete function mapping across all modules
  3. Systematic testing of each component
  4. Architecture review before any code changes

  The specialized agents would have caught the global function issues immediately. My incremental approach wasted
  your time.

  For complex applications like this, always start with: "Use agents to analyze the complete architecture first."
